## Description

SoWell uses computer vision libraries (OpenCV and MTCNN) and deep learning (DeepFace) to detect and analyze facial expressions in real-time. The detected emotion influences the AI therapist's tone, built using LangChain with Google's Gemini model. The user interface, styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS, includes a cityscape background with animated elements and a chat interface.
