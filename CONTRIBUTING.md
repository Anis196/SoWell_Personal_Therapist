```

#### ⚙️ Set Up the Environment
Follow the setup instructions in the project’s README.md to install dependencies and configure your development environment.

#### 🌱 Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your work using a descriptive name:

Run linters/formatters as specified in README.md.

#### ✅ Write Tests
Include appropriate tests to ensure quality.

Cover new functionality and bug fixes.

#### 📝 Update Documentation

### 3. Submitting Your Contribution

#### 🚀 Push Changes
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

#### 🔀 Create a Pull Request (PR)
Open a PR to the main branch of the main Sowell repository.

Use a clear PR title and description.

Mention related issues using keywords (e.g., Fixes #123).

#### 🧐 Code Review
Respond to feedback.

Make any required changes.

Push updates to the same branch.

#### ✅ CI Checks
Ensure all automated checks (tests, linters) pass.

### 4. Reporting Issues
Go to the GitHub Issues tab.

Use clear titles and detailed descriptions.

Provide steps to reproduce (for bugs).

Follow the project’s Code of Conduct (if available).

Contact maintainers via Issues or at 📧 shaikhanis2004@gmail.com if you need help.

## 🔁 Development Workflow

#### 🌿 Branching
Use feature branches. Never commit directly to main.

#### 🧪 Testing
Run:

make test
```

Justify it in your PR.
